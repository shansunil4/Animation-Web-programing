	Ginkaku-ji Temple ("The Silver Pavilion") is on everyone’s checklist of sights to see while in Kyoto, 
	both foreigners and Japanese alike. We understand why: it’s about as beautiful as any temple in the city. 
	But, if you visit between 10am and 4pm, especially on a weekend or holiday, it is almost impossible to enjoy the place. </p>
